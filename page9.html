    <h2><i>My profession</i></h2>
    <p>I am very glad that I am studying to be a programmer, I get satisfaction when I learn it. <br>
        Now I have low skills, but I want to continue to study hard and very carefully so that my knowledge will increase by 30%. I want to understand JavaScript and some other front-end programming languages. I absorb knowledge with great interest because it's really cool for me and I want to have extraordinary abilities.
        Therefore, I hope my results will be noticeable and I will be proud of myself!<br>
    <i>p.s. I would like to program in Swifter language, but I don't have Mac</i></p>
