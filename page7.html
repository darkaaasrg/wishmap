    <h2><i>Hobby??</i></h2>
    <p>When people ask me what is your hobby besides reading and programming, I really want to answer <b>DANCING!!!</b><br>
        When I listened to K-pop a lot, I always wanted to go to dances that were related to K-pop, but later I just wanted to dance. For me, physical "load" means relaxation and getting rid of unnecessary emotions and thoughts. 
    Moreover, dancing is something that can get you in shape. 
    When I am engaged in an active lifestyle, I feel alive and satisfied. Therefore, I would like to try to go to dances.
