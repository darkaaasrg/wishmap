    <h2><i>I am strong and independent, but..</i></h2>
    <P>...but sometimes I want to hear <i>"honey, I'll do it myself", 
        "I love you", "I'll be there, don't worry"</i>.
        I want to be needed by someone, maybe I want a lot.
        In fact, I like all kinds of romantic things, I like to be taken care of.</P>
    <p>I won't lie that I really envy those who are loved and whom they consider their everything.
        My comfort is when a couple walks through a night city or a park, the girl laughs loudly.
        and tells how her day went, and the guy, 
        holding her hand, listens carefully.</p>
    <p>I need a man on whom I can rely 100%,
        with whom I will feel safe and to whom I can
        trust everything in the world, and he will understand me.</p>
