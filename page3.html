    <h2><i>I'm ashamed to study on a contract...</i></h2>
    <p>Having a job is very important to me.
        I want to cover my desires on my own, because I want a lot, but saying this to my parents, 
        who pay for education and an apartment, is very stupid. 
        They already do a lot for me. I'm just ashamed. Therefore, in 2024, I really hope that I will find a job. 
        I want to work, I want to earn MY money to feel comfortable. 
        Then I will not be so ashamed to spend them.</p>
        <h2><i>...or just independent?</i></h2>
        <p>I try not to be jealous, but I envy teenagers who have rich parents and get everything they want. I envy girls who are provided by a guy. In terms of money, I really envy people. I want to be rich.
            I want to be independent, I want to be able to afford everything I want.
            From the smallest to the largest.
            I want to depend only on myself.
            I want to work.</p>
