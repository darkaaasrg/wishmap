    <p>I'm so funny, I haven't learned English, but I want to learn Spanish. But it's not bad! On the contrary, it's cool when you want to learn something.<br>
        In fact, I have long considered learning Spanish as a second language for work. Moreover, I really want to go to Spain, so this will be another plus. 
        I like the language itself, how it sounds and how it is written. I hope I will at least study it a little.</p>
