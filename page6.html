    <p>I won't lie, I don't know English very well and I'm very ashamed of it. I repeatedly sat down to study the English language, but I always left this road...
        It is difficult for me to learn English, because it requires discipline, which I quickly run out of. I was ashamed in pairs, because I hardly understood or knew anything, it was very bad for me. <br>
        I want to know English at least to the b2 level, that's why I write this site exclusively in English, because I hope that you will be able to read it perfectly and translate it. I hope my English language skills will improve if 
        I really take it on. And I really will! I will try to raise my level, if it were not difficult for me</p>
