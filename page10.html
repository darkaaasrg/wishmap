    <h2><i>i'm too short?</i></h2>
    <p>As I said earlier: "physical "load" is relaxation for me." Therefore, volleyball is a good sport, but maybe I am too short? Say <b>NO</b> to stereotypes!! <br>
        Before, I didn't like volleyball, when I went to the game, when I heard this knock of the ball, I was excited. When I was going to the hall and heard how they were playing volleyball, it seemed to me that my heart would explode, and I would simply die from the emotions.
        I want to play volleyball for real, I want to feel the ball in my hands. Then I will be really happy.</p>
