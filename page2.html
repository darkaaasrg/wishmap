    <h2><i>It gives me motivation and strength..</i></h2>
    <p>In November 2023, I went to the hall for the first time. 
    It was my little dream that I was able to fulfill and I 
    felt incredible happiness and a surge of energy. After going for 1 month, I realized that I still 
    want to do sports and achieve results.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I don't go to the gym, but I really dream of continuing this activity, 
        because I feel happy and it allows me to relax.</p>
    <p>Gym - relaxation. he really gave me a break from a difficult period and gave me the strength to move on.
        I met a cool girl and had a great time, I was motivated by the people we met in the hall. I had a good time.</p>    
    <h2><i>My way!</i></h2>
    <p>To be honest, for a long time I couldn't bring myself to start visiting the gym...and even on Monday, November 6, I was thinking of some excuse not to go. It was stupid.
        I am glad that I overcame my fear and went.</p>
